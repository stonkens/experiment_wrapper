# Experiment Wrapper
Wrapper for experiments that do not have gym interface. Allows parallelizing experiments either during training validation or testing. Inspired by [Neural CLBF](https://github.com/MIT-REALM/neural_clbf) package from MIT REALM. 

TODO:
- [ ] Test functionality with torch.Tensor()'s
- [ ] Add an example for clarification
- [ ] Think about the ExperimentSuite functionality and how to implement it!
